# Implementing Backpropagation Algorithm in Matlab

This repository contains the backpropagation algorithm implemented in matlab accompanied by a graphic user interface as an interactive form. The data used is a letter image from the handwriting dataset into the classification task. The algorithm explains the learning mechanism of backpropagation in simple terms.
